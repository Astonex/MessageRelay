Message Relay for Tox

Forwards all incoming messages to another Tox account, storing any messages when you're offline.

Currently only allows for forwaring to a single account.

Can toggle the relay to only store messages for when you're offline as opposed to actively relaying messages when you're online as well.

To compile it just run ./compile. You'll need the tox libs installed on your distro
